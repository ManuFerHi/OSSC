OSSC ManuFerHi version <BR>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction"> Introduction </span></h2>
<p>The <b>O</b>pen <b>S</b>ource <b>S</b>can <b>C</b>onverter is a low-latency video digitizer and scan converter designed primarily for connecting retro video game consoles and home computers to modern displays. It converts analog RGB or component video signals into a digital format, and doubles (or triples) the scanlines of a single frame if necessary to generate a valid mode for digital TVs or monitors.
</p><p>The board and firmware originated as a homebrew project in 2015. The primary goal of the OSSC project was to create a scan converter with minimal latency and reasonable cost, which could also be assembled by hand. Output image quality and features have also been important targets as long as they didn't contradict with the project's primary goals.
</p><p>Due to interest in the retro gaming community, both DIY kits and pre-assembled boards were first released to the public during early 2016. The firmware of the system is open source (hence the name) and new features can be added as time goes on.
</p><p>If you're new to the OSSC and scalers/processors in general, you may wish to start with the quick start guide <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.videogameperfection.com/support-files/ossc-quickstart.pdf">here.</a>
