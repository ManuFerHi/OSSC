<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction"> Introduction </span></h2>
<p>The <b>O</b>pen <b>S</b>ource <b>S</b>can <b>C</b>onverter is a low-latency video digitizer and scan converter designed primarily for connecting retro video game consoles and home computers to modern displays. It converts analog RGB or component video signals into a digital format, and doubles (or triples) the scanlines of a single frame if necessary to generate a valid mode for digital TVs or monitors.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Features"> Features </span></h3>
<ul><li> Detection and digitization of various analog SDTV/EDTV/HDTV/PC modes
</li><li> Line double support for 240p, 480i, 288p, 576i, 384p, 480p, 576p
</li><li> Line3x/4x/5x support for 240p/288p with different sampling modes
</li><li> Very low latency (less than 2 input scanlines)
</li><li> Fast "deinterlace" for 480i/576i and 960i/1080i
</li><li> Fast recover from input video mode change (e.g. 240p&lt;-&gt;480i)
</li><li> All video processing done in RGB domain - no conversion to YCbCr
</li><li> Video and sync LPF for less-than optimal input signals
</li><li> Multiple inputs supporting various formats (see below)
</li><li> Full-range 24-bit RGB output through DVI/HDMI
</li><li> Emulated scanlines with configurable strength and position
</li><li> Configurable mask for overscan area
</li><li> Selectable sampling configuration for 480p input: DTV-480p or VGA 640x480
</li><li> Selectable CSC configuration for YPbPr source: Rec. 601 or Rec. 709
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Power"> Power </span></h2>
<p>OSSC requires an external DC power supply. A unit that outputs 5 volts DC with at least 1 Amp will work. The tip must be 2.1 x 5.5mm and centre positive. 
</p><p>If desired, a USB to Barrel Jack adapter can be used. This will function correctly as long as the USB port or charger used in conjunction with OSSC outputs at least 1 amp of current. Such adapters can often be found on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Barrel-Jack-Adapter-USB-5-5mm/dp/B00LX8MULA">Amazon</a> or other popular retailers.
</p><p>Do not use a power supply rated for AC output, or a power supply rated higher than 5 volts DC, doing so can damage the OSSC. 
</p><p>Using a supply that provides less than one amp of current may cause the OSSC to reset, especially when outputting at higher resolutions. You can however, safely use a PSU rated at least one amp or higher.
